        Problem description:  Create a program that will obtain a base from the user, a beginning exponent from the user, 
        and an ending exponent from the user and will print out the value of the base taken to the exponent power 
        for all of the exponents from the beginning to the ending exponent.  Use a method, Power, to calculate the value.  
        Be sure that both the base and exponents are integers greater than or equal to 1, and that the ending 
        exponent is greater than the beginning exponent. Repeat the process until the user wants to quit.

        Algorithm:
        
        Do
            Obtain base, beginning exponent and ending exponent from user.
                if, base and exponents are integers greater than or equal to 1 AND ending exponent is greater than beginning exponent.  
                // check with this? aboveZeroCheck(n1, n2, n3).
                        Print out the value of the base taken to the exponent power for all of the exponents from the beginning to ending.
                            Use a method called Power() to calculate the value.
                                Repeat process while user wants to quit. 
                else, display Error: Please enter a whole number greater than 0, and make sure ending exponent is bigger than beginning exponent.
        While the user doesn't want to quit.

        End program
